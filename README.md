# Light-Curve-Classification
This is a project developed during "La Serena School for Data Science".
The main goal is to separate the light curves from the Catalina Real Time Transient Survey by class.
We use Python2.7

##Running the Code

### Prerequisites

Recomended: Using a virtual environment, so we don't run into environment problems

```
virtualenv  lsdss 
source lsdss/bin/activate

```

After creating and activating the virtual environment, we install the packages required


```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### Running the Code

```
python light_curves.py

```
